## Communication Channels

### GitHub Issues

**Purpose**: Bug reports, feature requests, and technical discussions

**Best Practices**:
```markdown
# Good issue titles
✅ "Android: friTap fails to detect BoringSSL in Flutter apps"
✅ "Feature request: Add support for RustTLS library"
✅ "Documentation: Installation guide missing Node.js requirements"

# Avoid
❌ "It doesn't work"
❌ "Help needed"
❌ "Bug"
```

**Issue Templates**:

#### Bug Report Template
```markdown
**Describe the bug**
A clear description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Run command: `fritap -k keys.log target_app`
2. Observe error: '...'

**Expected behavior**
What you expected to happen.

**Environment**
- OS: [e.g. Linux Ubuntu 20.04]
- friTap version: [e.g. 1.3.5]
- Python version: [e.g. 3.9.7]
- Frida version: [e.g. 16.0.19]
- Target application: [e.g. Firefox 108.0]

**Additional context**
Debug output, screenshots, or other relevant information.
```

#### Feature Request Template
```markdown
**Is your feature request related to a problem?**
Describe the problem you're trying to solve.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Clear description of what you want to happen.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Alternative solutions or features you've considered.

**Additional context**
Use cases, examples, or mockups.

**Implementation ideas**
If you have technical suggestions for implementation.
```

### GitHub Discussions

**Purpose**: General questions, community conversations, and announcements

**Categories**:
- **Q&A**: Ask questions and get help
- **Ideas**: Propose new features or improvements
- **Show and Tell**: Share your friTap projects and analyses
- **General**: Community chat and discussions

**Example Discussions**:
```markdown
# Q&A: "How to analyze Flutter apps with custom SSL implementations?"
I'm trying to analyze a Flutter app that seems to use a custom SSL library. 
Standard friTap hooks don't seem to work. Has anyone encountered this before?

# Ideas: "Integration with YARA rules for automated analysis"
Would it be useful to integrate YARA rules to automatically categorize 
and analyze SSL traffic patterns? This could help identify malware families 
or suspicious behavior.

# Show and Tell: "friTap analysis of banking app reveals interesting patterns"
I used friTap to analyze traffic from a banking app and found some 
interesting certificate pinning bypass techniques. Here's what I learned...
```

### Pull Request Discussions

**Purpose**: Code review, technical feedback, and collaboration on changes

**Guidelines**:
- **Be constructive**: Focus on the code, not the person
- **Provide context**: Explain why changes are needed
- **Suggest solutions**: Don't just point out problems
- **Ask questions**: Seek to understand before criticizing

```markdown
# Good PR feedback
✅ "This function could be more efficient. Consider using a dict lookup instead 
   of multiple if-statements. Here's an example: [code snippet]"

✅ "Great approach! One concern: how does this handle the case where the SSL 
   library is dynamically loaded? Should we add a retry mechanism?"

✅ "The TypeScript looks good, but we should add error handling for the case 
   where Module.getExportByName() fails. What do you think about wrapping 
   it in a try-catch?"

# Avoid
❌ "This is wrong."
❌ "Bad code."
❌ "Why did you do it this way?"
```

### Email Communication

**Purpose**: Direct contact with maintainers for sensitive issues

**When to use email**:
- Security vulnerability reports
- Code of conduct violations
- Private licensing questions
- Collaboration proposals

**Email**: [daniel.baier@fkie.fraunhofer.de](mailto:daniel.baier@fkie.fraunhofer.de)

## Getting Help

### Before Asking for Help

1. **Search existing resources**:
   - [Documentation](https://fkie-cad.github.io/friTap)
   - [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/fkie-cad/friTap/issues)
   - [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/fkie-cad/friTap/discussions)

2. **Try troubleshooting**:
   - Enable debug output: `fritap -do -v target_app`
   - Check system requirements
   - Verify target application compatibility

3. **Prepare information**:
   - System details (OS, versions, etc.)
   - Complete error messages
   - Steps to reproduce
   - What you've already tried

### How to Ask Good Questions

#### Structure Your Question

```markdown
## Context
I'm trying to analyze SSL traffic from a mobile banking app on Android.

## What I'm trying to do
Extract SSL keys from com.bank.mobile using friTap.

## What I've tried
```bash
fritap -m -k keys.log com.bank.mobile
```

## What happened
friTap starts but doesn't detect any SSL libraries:
```
[*] Starting friTap analysis
[*] Target: com.bank.mobile (PID: 12345)
[*] No SSL libraries detected
[*] Analysis stopped
```

## Environment
- OS: Android 11 (API 30)
- Device: Pixel 5 (rooted)
- friTap version: 1.3.5
- Frida version: 16.0.19
- frida-server: 16.0.19

## Debug output
```
[debug output here]
```

## Question
Has anyone seen this before? Could the app be using a custom SSL implementation?
```

#### Follow-Up Etiquette

```markdown
# When you get help
✅ "Thank you! That solved the issue. The problem was [explanation]. 
   This might help others with similar setups."

✅ "I tried your suggestion but I'm still getting errors. Here's the updated 
   debug output: [new information]"

# Provide updates
✅ "Update: I figured it out! The issue was [solution]. Thanks for pointing 
   me in the right direction."

# Close the loop
✅ "Resolved! For anyone else with this issue: [summary of solution]"
```

### Response Times

**Expected response times** (not guaranteed):
- **Critical security issues**: 24-48 hours
- **Bug reports**: 2-7 days
- **Feature requests**: 1-2 weeks
- **Questions**: 1-7 days

**Community responses** are often faster than maintainer responses. Help each other!

## Contributing to Community

### Helping Others

#### Answer Questions
- Monitor GitHub Discussions and Issues
- Share your experience and knowledge
- Provide clear, helpful responses
- Direct people to relevant documentation

```markdown
# Good community response
"I had a similar issue with Android apps. The problem is usually that the 
app uses a custom SSL library or BoringSSL is statically linked. Try these steps:

1. First, check what libraries are loaded:
   ```bash
   fritap -m --list-libraries com.your.app
   ```

2. If you see libflutter.so or similar, you'll need patterns:
   ```bash
   mkdir patterns && cp libflutter.so patterns/
   # Generate patterns with BoringSecretHunter
   fritap --patterns pattern.json -m -k keys.log com.your.app
   ```

See the [Pattern-Based Hooking Guide](link) for more details."
